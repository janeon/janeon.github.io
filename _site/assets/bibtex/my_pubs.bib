abstract = {{Programmers consistently engage in cognitively demanding tasks such as sense making and decision-making. During the information-foraging process, programmers are growing more reliant on resources available online since they contain masses of crowdsourced information and are easier to navigate. Content available in questions and answers on Stack Overflow presents a unique platform for studying the types of problems encountered in programming and possible solutions. In addition to classifying these questions, we introduce possible visual representations for organizing the gathered information and propose that such models may help reduce the cost of navigating, understanding and choosing solution alternatives.}},

abstract = {{Polarization-analyzed small-angle neutron-scattering methods are used to determine the spin arrangements and experimental length scales of magnetic correlations in ordered three-dimensional assemblies of ∼7.4-nm-diam core-shell Fe3O4/MnxFe3−xO4 nanoparticles. In moderate to high magnetic fields, the assemblies display a canted magnetic structure where the canting direction is coherent from nanoparticle to nanoparticle, in contrast to the less extended, more single-particle-like behavior for similar ferrite assemblies. The observed magnetic scattering is modeled by assuming that the interparticle dipolar coupling combined with Zeeman effects in a field leads to nanoparticle domains with preferred net spin alignments relative to packing symmetry axes. Over a range of fields and temperatures, the model qualitatively explains the observed scattering anomalies in terms of clusters that vary in area and thickness, highlighting the complex structures adopted in real, dense nanoparticle systems. The clusters often have a strong two-dimensional magnetic character which is attributed to structural stacking faults and the resulting influence of interparticle dipolar interactions for these magnetically soft nanoparticles.}},

abstract = {{Developers spend a significant portion of their time searching for solutions and methods online. While numerous tools have been developed to support this exploratory process, in many cases the answers to developers' questions involve trade-offs among multiple valid options and not just a single solution. Through interviews, we discovered that developers express a desire for help with decision-making and understanding trade-offs. Through an analysis of Stack Overflow posts, we observed that many answers describe such trade-offs. These findings suggest that tools designed to help a developer capture information and make decisions about trade-offs can provide crucial benefits for both the developers and others who want to understand their design rationale. In this work, we probe this hypothesis with a prototype system named Unakite that collects, organizes, and keeps track of information about trade-offs and builds a comparison table, which can be saved as a design rationale for later use. Our evaluation results show that Unakite reduces the cost of capturing tradeoff-related information by 45\%, and that the resulting comparison table speeds up a subsequent developer's ability to understand the trade-offs by about a factor of three.}},
