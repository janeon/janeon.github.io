summary: Constructing Effective Stack Overflow Questions

Ever feel intimidated to ask questions on Stack Overflow? Ever have a question that was asked but never answered on SO?

You're not alone. Turns out that

&emsp; - only 5.8% of the sites on SO are women as of 2016

&emsp; - less than a quarter of the developers are newcomers (<5 years of experience) and

&emsp; - more than 30% of questions on the site are left unanswered

To mitigate some of these issues, I completed (as a part of an honors project) some extensive literature review to find qualities of good questions that earned high social approval via the reputation system, and used these to build a Chrome sidebar that:

1. dynamically evaluates the current quality of a question under construction on SO
2. makes suggested improvements based upon the evaluation and
3. displays answer previews of relevant questions
