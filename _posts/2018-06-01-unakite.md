This project centers around the comparison table: a visual model that supports and documents a programmerâ€™s information collection and decision making processes by forming a tabular representation of the problem space. The implemented comparison table has three major components:

1. Option - every option/solution is represented by a row, and each is labeled in the row header
2. Criteria - each criteria of the issue/problem is shown as a column, each labeled by a column header
3. Snippets - pieces of html collections taken from webpages that users found when searching for a solution

These are gathered into a table into the following, where options can be rated to either fulfill or miss criteria. Each rating will be supported by a piece of evidence stored in a snippet.

<h3>My contributions</h3>

- User testing
  - A/B testing to test if a comparison table actually enhances understanding over a raw Stack Overflow page (preliminary results were promising!)
- Manually analyzed SO questions to find that approximately half of them are adaptable to the tabular format
  - I [published](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~NatProg/papers/p305-hsieh.pdf) and presented these findings at the [2018 VL/HCC conference](https://vlhcc18.github.io/)!
- Did a bunch of scenario-based design thinking and wireframing, some of the ideation can be found below
