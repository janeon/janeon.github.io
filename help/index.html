      <h2>Tasks </h2>
      <h3> What is a Task?</h3>
      As the name suggests, a task can be anything from "How do I resolve a linker command failed with exit code 1 error?" to "How do I undo commits in Git?" to "What resturants are available for dinner?"
      It also doesn't have to be a question, another task could be "Picking framework for a project".
      <p>
      Tasks can be added, edited, deleted, or combined. You can also mark a task as ongoing or completed.
      </p>
      <h3> How to Start a Task</h3>
      <p>A new task can be initiated with the <b>Start as NEW task</b> button next to the search bar on any Google search page</p>
      <img src="startbutton.png" alt="Start Button Example">
      <p>Alternatively, the select popover also has a button to start a new task. Simply highlight some html text and you will see the popover option <b>New Task</b></p>

    </div>
    <div id='Options'>
      <h2>Options </h2>
      <h3> What is an Option?</h3>
      Options are the various way that a task or problem may be completed or solved. Options may be created, deleted, starred, or marked as used.
      <h3> How to Add/Collect an Option</h3>
      An option may added from the extension popup or the the interaction box when collecting a snippet (see how to collect one in the <i>Snippets</i> section).
      <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
          <img src="popupOption.png" alt="Popup option" style="width:100%">
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <img src="interaction box.png" alt="Interaction Box" style="width:100%">
        </div>
      </div>
      Options may be collected from the selection popover or the context menu, which can be accessed via right clicking.
      <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
          <img src="selectOption.png" alt="Select Option" style="width:100%">
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <img src="context menu.png" alt="Context Menu" style="width:100%">

        </div>
      </div>
      <h3>Edit, Delete, Star or Use an Option</h3>
      <p>Options can be edited by clicking inside their boxes in the extension popup or comparison table.</p>
      Options can be deleted from the extension popup using the delete button on the top right of each option.
      <p>An option can be starred in the popup or from the comparison table on the mainpage.</p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
          <img src="Star in popup.png" alt="Popup Stars" style="width:100%">
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <img src="Star in comparison table.png" alt="Comparison Table Stars" style="width:100%">
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>An option may also be marked as used in the comparison table.</p>
      <img src="Use an option.png" alt="Use an option" style="width:100%">
    </div>
    <div id='Criteria'>
      <h2>Criteria </h2>
      <h3>What is an Criterion?</h3>
      Criteria are characteristics or of an option or potential situations where it would become useful. Often they measure the usefulness of certain option(s).
      <h3>Edit, Add, Delete, or Star Criteria</h3>
      Criteria can be edited, added, deleted, and starred in the same ways as options, but they <i>cannot</i> be marked as used.
    </div>
    <div id='Snippets'>
      <h2>Snippets and Rating</h2>
      <h3>What is a Snippet?</h3>
      Snippets are chunks of information or code snippets from the web which are relevant to the current task.
      Snippets may be collected (as opposed to being manually added by user) through the selection popover, context menu, the custom Stack Overflow Snippet button, or the Option + drag tool.
      <h3>How to Collect a Snippet</h3>
      Like options and criteria, snippets may also be collected through the selection popover and context menu. But to preserve the formatting of code snippets or other html sections, we introduce the custom drag tool.
      To use, simply hold down option key and drag with the mouse to collect a section of html on the web page.
      <img src="dragSelect.gif" alt="Drag Selection" style="width:100%">
      Notice that each Stack Overflow post also receives its own "snippet button". Clicking this button will save the post as an <i>uncategorized</i> snippet.
    </div>
    <div id='FAQ'>
      <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <h3>What information does the extension track?</h3>
      If you the user is logged in and actively working on a task, UNAKITE will track visited web pages and search queries, in addition to any user inputs into UNAKITE (options, criteria, snippets, and notes).
      Note that you can stop the extension from tracking of all web pages under <i>Settings</i>.
